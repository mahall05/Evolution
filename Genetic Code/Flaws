Immediate flaw is the way the the best one is picked. The best dot is picked based off of how close it is to the goal.
The problem is, this means they will keep smashing into the wall straight on because it gets them the closest, rather than going around the 
wall to get even close. Because if they started going around, that would technically get them further from the goal.
I'm not sure how to fix this issue.
