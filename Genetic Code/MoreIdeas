1. Calculate fitness based on the closest it EVER got, not just where it died
2. Menu to select options
3. Better tune the movement
4. Make a baby with the top two dots, rather than just cloning the best
5. Give the ability for the player to take over a dot??  (Use KeyInput class from eclipse)
6. Have a system that encourages new thinking (mutations) (more mutations with the same performance gets better fitness rating)
7. If the dots are staying within the same score range for a while, increase the mutation rate
8. Have mutations only happen later rather than having a flat mutation rate (see number 12)
9. Have a random chance to skip a step, and have that choice carry over to the next generation
10. Directional movement/facing an angle
11. Add the ability to export the current best path to pickup where I left off (Ryan's idea)
12. Possibly, with a combination of number 1 and number 8, have mutations occur only after the best possible position?

1. This worked amazingly. The dots are much smarter now and get to the goal much faster
2. 
3. 
4. 
5.
6. 
7. This worked successfully, but had a negative side effect. More mutation means they just get worse and worse. The mutations need to happen later on
    rather than effecting their entire path
8. 
9. This works... kind of? Something isn't right with it though. It breaks everything, so not really
10.
