1. Calculate fitness based on the closest it EVER got, not just where it died
2. Menu to select options
3. Better tune the movement
4. Make a baby with the top two dots, rather than just cloning the best
5. Give the ability for the player to take over a dot??  (Use KeyInput class from eclipse)
6. Have a system that encourages new thinking (mutations)
7. If the dots are staying within the same score range for a while, increase the mutation rate
8. Have mutations only happen later rather than having a flat mutation rate
9. Have a random chance to skip a step, and have that choice carry over to the next generation
10. Directional movement/facing an angle
